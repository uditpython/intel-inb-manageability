The dispatcher.py file is well-structured and follows good practices. However, there are a few areas where it could be improved:

Error Handling: The code does not have any error handling. It would be helpful to have try/except blocks to catch and handle potential errors. For example, the make_dispatcher function could raise an exception if the args parameter is not a list.

Logging: The code does not have any logging. It would be helpful to add logging statements to track the flow of execution and help with debugging. For example, you could log the start and end of the main function, and any errors that occur.

Code Duplication: The WindowsDispatcherService class and the main function both create a dispatcher using the make_dispatcher function. This could be moved to a separate function to reduce code duplication.

Type Annotations: The type annotations in the code could be more specific. For example, the args parameter in the make_dispatcher function and the WindowsDispatcherService class could be annotated as List[str] instead of just List.

Docstrings: The docstrings in the code could be more detailed. For example, the docstring for the make_dispatcher function could explain what the args parameter is and what it does.

Here's how you might implement these improvements:

import logging
from typing import Optional

# ...

def make_dispatcher(args: Optional[List[str]]] = None) -> Dispatcher:
    """Make a dispatcher with the given args.

    Handle dependency injection in one place"""
    if args is None:
        args = []
    if not isinstance(args, list):
        raise TypeError("args must be a list")
    broker = DispatcherBroker()
    return Dispatcher(args=args, broker=broker, install_check_service=InstallCheckService(broker))


class WindowsDispatcherService(WindowsService):
    # ...

    def __init__(self, args: Optional[List[str]] = None) -> None:
        if args is None:
            args = []
        if not isinstance(args, list):
            raise TypeError("args must be a list")

        self.dispatcher = make_dispatcher(args)

        super().__init__(args)

    # ...


def main() -> None:
    """Function called by __main__."""
    logging.info("Starting main function")

    try:
        if platform.system() == 'Windows':
            # ...
        else:
            dispatcher = make_dispatcher(sys.argv)
            dispatcher.start()
    except Exception as e:
        logging.error(f"An error occurred: {e}")
        raise

    logging.info("Ending main function")


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
