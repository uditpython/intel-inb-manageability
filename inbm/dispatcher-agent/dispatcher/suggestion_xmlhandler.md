The XmlHandler class in your xmlhandler.py file is well-structured and follows good practices. However, there are a few areas where it could be improved:

Error Handling: The XmlHandler class raises XmlException for various types of errors. It would be helpful to have more specific exception classes for different types of errors, such as XmlValidationException, XmlParseException, etc. This would make it easier to handle specific types of errors in the code that uses this class.

Logging: The logging in the XmlHandler class could be more descriptive. For example, in the get_element method, the log message is just an empty string. It would be more helpful to have a message that describes what the method is doing, such as "Getting element at XPath: {xpath}".

Code Duplication: There is some code duplication in the XmlHandler class that could be reduced. For example, the code to check if the schema file exists is repeated in the _validate method. This could be moved to a separate method, such as _check_schema_exists, and called from _validate.

Type Annotations: The type annotations in the XmlHandler class could be more specific. For example, the get_children method returns a Dict[str, Any], but it would be more helpful to specify what types of values can be in the dictionary.

Docstrings: The docstrings in the XmlHandler class could be more detailed. For example, the docstring for the get_element method doesn't explain what the xpath parameter is. It would be helpful to have a more detailed explanation of this parameter and what it does.

Unused Variables: The tasks variable in the __init__ method is not used. If it's not needed, it should be removed to avoid confusion.

Here's how you might implement these improvements:

.
Remember to replace XmlException with XmlValidationException or XmlParseException in the appropriate places.

class XmlValidationException(XmlException):
    """Raised when XML validation fails."""
    pass

class XmlParseException(XmlException):
    """Raised when XML parsing fails."""
    pass

# ...

class XmlHandler:
    # ...

    def __init__(self, xml: str, is_file: bool, schema_location: Union[str, pathlib.Path]) -> None:
        # ...
        with ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=1) as executor:
            future = executor.submit(self._getroot, xml)
            try:
                self._root = future.result(timeout=PARSE_TIME_SECS)
            except TimeoutError:
                raise XmlException("XML Parser timed out.")

    def _check_schema_exists(self) -> None:
        if not os.path.exists(self._schema_location):
            raise XmlException("Schema file not found at location: " + str(self._schema_location))

    def _validate(self, xml: str) -> Any:
        # ...
        self._check_schema_exists()
        # ...

    def get_element(self, xpath: str) -> str:
        logger.debug(f"Getting element at XPath: {xpath}")
        # ...

    def get_children(self, xpath) -> Dict[str, Union[str, List[str]]]:
        # ...

    # ...
